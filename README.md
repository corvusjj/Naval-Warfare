## Description

The purpose of this project is to implement the basics of Test Driven Development, and to practice app functionality separation. It is a part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum on their Full Stack Javascript course - "Testing Javascript" section. This is the first project where I first learned and implemented Typescript. This is also where I discovered Vite and decided to transition from Webpack due to less configurations and the efficiency it provides for development.

As more features were developed, I also encountered more challenges especially the AI. The computer opponent was the most difficult but the most time I spent with is the DOM. The user inputs' requirements from the game logic was more complicated than what I expected.   

## Features

- 🧠 **AI Behavior**: The AI opponent strategically follows a diagonal line of squares for offense, maintains fair gameplay without cheating.
- 🛰️ **Fleet Status**: Displays the opponent's remaining ships and reveal both players' fleets when the game is over.
